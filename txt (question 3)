Compare the amount of code and simplicity between the node.js HTTP server and the  Express.js server

Node.js HTTP server is good for small, simple applications but requires more boilerplate code to handle routing and responses.
Express.js is much simpler and cleaner for creating servers, especially for larger applications. It reduces the amount of code significantly and adds more flexibility with its middleware and routing system.
